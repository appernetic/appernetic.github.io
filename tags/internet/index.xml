      <description>Static website service performance improvements We have made significant performance improvements in our static website service and have dug deep into everything on the client and server side. All images are now sent with Cloudinary&amp;rsquo;s Akamai CDN including the favicon, and every CSS, HTML and Javascript file are compressed and minified.
Speed Index We use webpagetest for our performance tests. As a measure of how one experiences the web page speed we use Speed Index.</description>

Then I found ColdFusion in the beginning of 1995 and the sites I built had dynamic content served from MS Access databases.</description>
