      <description>Site preview fixes and enhancements There was a case of a very sticky cache and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well if you immediately would want to check changes. Site preview has also been moved to its own subdomain: preview.appernetic.io, and now it is also possible to view the site preview if you are not signed in, so it is easier to share the URL and collaborate.
If you are experiencing problems such as site preview URL goes to a page that does not exist, try clearing the cache in your browser.</description>
