      <description>Pain point  I&amp;rsquo;m looking to put up a &amp;lsquo;coming soon&amp;rsquo; page for a podcast I&amp;rsquo;m working on to collect some e-mails for the upcoming launch.
What&amp;rsquo;s a good ready-made solution for this (e.g. WordPress plugin, hosted landing page, etc.) that allows for easy lead collection without custom coding or monthly fee?
 That was the question I saw in the 7 Day Startup group on Facebook. Similar questions were asked in Hugo Community discuss : Is it possible to add a contact form to a site?</description>

      <description>Cloudinary for image and video assets management in your static website We no longer use GitHub to manage images in your Appernetic static website service account. You can still use GitHub and they have an easy to use image upload, but to use Appernetic&amp;rsquo;s image upload you now have to first create a Cloudinary account. The advantages of using Cloudinary is so big that it was an easy decision to integrate it.</description>
