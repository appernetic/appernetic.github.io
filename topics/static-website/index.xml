      <description>The theme showcase gallery is ready! Now you can browse the gallery and install a theme just by clicking on it. This is the themes listed at Hugo Theme Showcase.
Aggregated meta information We automatically aggregate and build a JSON file each week that contains the extracted meta information from each of the 86 themes.
I also check if each theme has an exampleSite folder and a config.toml file and if they have we give them a star in the frontend.</description>

      <description>Customizing themes If you just have set up your Appernetic static website service account you need to add a theme. The easiest way is to clone a theme which you can do from the menu button.
You can start by cloning my customized hugo-bootstrap theme or get one from Hugo. Then select the theme from the list of themes and click Use Theme. When you do that the theme config settings will be copied to your project folder.</description>
